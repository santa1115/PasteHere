# Paste Here for iOS

Since iOS doesn't have a "Mouse Right-Click", we use the **Share Sheet** or a **Home Screen Widget**.

## 🚀 How to Create the Shortcut

1.  Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iPhone/iPad.
2.  Tap **+** to create a new shortcut.
3.  Name it **"Paste & Download"**.
4.  Add the following actions:

    *   **Get Clipboard**
    *   **Get Contents of URL** (Method: GET)
        *   *Connect this to the Clipboard output*
    *   **Save File**
        *   *Turn off "Ask Where to Save" if you want it to save to a specific folder automatically.*

## 📱 How to Use

1.  **Copy** a link to a file (or an image).
2.  Tap the **"Paste & Download"** shortcut widget.
3.  The file will be downloaded and saved to your iCloud Drive / Files.
