## 💡 Why use PasteHere?

### Problem 1: The "Double Navigation" Loop
You found a perfect image on the web. You want it into a specific project folder.
**The Old Way:** "Save Image As..." -> Find folder (Time lost) -> Save -> Find folder again to use it.
**The PasteHere Way:** Copy -> Go to folder -> **Paste Here**.
> **WYSIWYG**: You are already in the folder. Why leave it?

### Problem 2: The "Lost Screenshot"
You took a screenshot (PrintScreen / Snip tool) but forgot to save it as a file?
**The Old Way:** Open Paint -> Paste -> Save As -> Find folder -> Save.
**The PasteHere Way:** Right-click -> **Paste Here**.
> Instantly saved as `Image_202x...png`. No external editor needed.
